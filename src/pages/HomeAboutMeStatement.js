        Hi, I'm Rizwan ðŸ‘‹ and I am a Software Engineer.
        I like bringing ideas to life using  code.

        <hr style={{ border: 'none', color: 'transparent', backgroundColor: 'transparent' }} />
        Over the years I've had the chance to work at some amazing places and had the opportunity to work on some really cool projects.
        Currently, I'm working as a consultant.
        Please check out my  
        <span className="cool-effect" style={{fontStyle: "italic"}}> &nbsp;
          <Link to="/project_page" className="cool-effect" style={{ fontStyle: "italic" }}>
            Projects 
          </Link> &nbsp;
        </span> 
        page for some of the cool stuff I've built over the years.
        <hr style={{ border: 'none', color: 'transparent', backgroundColor: 'transparent' }} />
        I'm based in the greater New York City area and like to run, play soccer and read in my free time. Please feel free to reach out 
        if you're looking to connect.
